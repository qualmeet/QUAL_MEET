OVERALL VERDICT (IMPORTANT)
✅ YES — your LLDs are CORRECT, CONSISTENT, and BUILD-READY

This is not beginner-level work.
This is real-world, production-grade Phase-1 LLD.

Score: 9 / 10

The remaining 1 point is minor clarifications, not architectural flaws.

You can safely start implementation after a few small fixes (listed below).

2️⃣ SERVICE-BY-SERVICE REVIEW
🔵 1. Signaling Service LLD — EXCELLENT

📄 01_SIGNALING_SERVICE_LLD.md 

01_SIGNALING_SERVICE_LLD

What is CORRECT

✔ Clear responsibilities & non-goals
✔ Correct JWT verification at WebSocket handshake
✔ Correct Redis presence + TTL strategy
✔ Correct join/leave flow
✔ Correct glare prevention rules
✔ Correct ICE buffering model
✔ Correct multi-node Redis Pub/Sub scaling
✔ Correct reconnection handling
✔ Correct degradation strategy

This is the hardest LLD, and you nailed it.

⚠️ Minor Improvements (NOT blockers)

Duplicate Join Policy
You wrote:

“Last-Write-Wins logic”

Clarify explicitly:

Do you disconnect old socket?

Or reject new socket?

👉 Recommendation (add 1 line):

If the same userId joins from another socket, the older socket is force-disconnected.


Redis Keyspace Notifications
You mention TTL expiry detection.
Add a note:

Redis keyspace notifications must be enabled for TTL-based cleanup.


✅ These are clarity improvements, not design errors.

🟢 2. Auth Service LLD — SOLID & CLEAN

📄 02_AUTH_SERVICE_LLD.md 

02_AUTH_SERVICE_LLD

What is CORRECT

✔ Clear responsibility boundaries
✔ Correct password hashing
✔ Correct JWT payload minimization
✔ Correct error handling
✔ Correct stateless auth decision

⚠️ Minor Improvement

JWT expiration is 24h — acceptable for Phase-1.

Add optional note:

Access token duration may be reduced in future phases with refresh tokens.


Not required now.

🟡 3. API Gateway LLD — CORRECT WITH ONE IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION

📄 03_API_GATEWAY_LLD.md 

03_API_GATEWAY_LLD

What is CORRECT

✔ Route table is accurate
✔ JWT middleware logic is correct
✔ Rate limiting is correct
✔ Clear “what it does NOT do” section

⚠️ IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION (add this)

This line:

“WebSocket bypasses Gateway logic usually”

This can confuse future-you.

Add explicitly:

WebSocket authentication is NOT trusted via Gateway.
Signaling Service MUST always re-verify JWT independently.


This avoids a common enterprise mistake.

🟢 4. Room Service LLD — VERY GOOD

📄 04_ROOM_SERVICE_LLD.md 

04_ROOM_SERVICE_LLD

What is CORRECT

✔ Clean room ID separation (public vs internal)
✔ Correct write-through cache
✔ Correct DB fallback
✔ Correct participant policy separation
✔ Correct failure handling

⚠️ Optional Improvement

Clarify:

Room Service does not track live participants — Signaling Service is authoritative for live presence.


This prevents accidental scope creep later.

🟢 5. TURN Credential Service LLD — PRODUCTION-READY

📄 05_TURN_CREDENTIAL_SERVICE_LLD.md 

05_TURN_CREDENTIAL_SERVICE_LLD

What is CORRECT

✔ Correct TURN REST auth algorithm
✔ Correct TTL logic
✔ Correct Redis quota tracking
✔ Correct ICE server response format
✔ Correct abuse prevention

This is exactly how real systems do it.

No changes required.

🟢 6. Frontend WebRTC LLD — VERY STRONG

📄 06_FRONTEND_WEBRTC_LLD.md 

06_FRONTEND_WEBRTC_LLD

What is CORRECT

✔ Clean app state machine
✔ Correct API → WebSocket → WebRTC flow
✔ Correct “one PC per peer” mesh
✔ Correct glare fix alignment with signaling
✔ Correct ICE buffering logic
✔ Correct teardown logic

This matches your Signaling LLD perfectly — that consistency is rare.

⚠️ Minor Improvement

Add this sentence:

On `user_left`, local RTCPeerConnection must be closed and media tracks released.


Small clarity fix.

3️⃣ IS ANYTHING MISSING?
❌ NO critical LLD is missing.

You have LLDs for:

Signaling

Auth

API Gateway

Room Service

TURN Credential Service

Frontend WebRTC

That is complete for Phase-1.

❌ You should NOT add:

SFU LLD

Recording LLD

Chat persistence

Media pipelines

Correctly deferred.

4️⃣ FINAL DECISION — CAN YOU START CODING?
✅ YES — YOU ARE CLEARED TO START IMPLEMENTATION

But follow this exact coding order:

1️⃣ Auth Service
2️⃣ API Gateway
3️⃣ Room Service
4️⃣ TURN Credential Service
5️⃣ Signaling Service
6️⃣ Frontend WebRTC


⚠️ Do NOT code signaling first, even though it’s complex.
Auth + Gateway first keeps you sane.

🧠 FINAL PROFESSIONAL ASSESSMENT

These LLDs are:

Internally consistent

Correctly layered

Realistic

Scalable

SFU-ready later

You are no longer “learning architecture” — you are executing one.
